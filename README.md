This hosts my langtons ant and uses DB cached server side functions for information retrieval.

1. npm init (server.js is entry point)
2. npm install express
3. npm start (exposes server to loopack address)

clients connecting get the client-folder and view the page inside.
the langtonsant.js fetches the html-title from the server which invokes a server-side DB cached .js.
